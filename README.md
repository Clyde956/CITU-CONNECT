# CITU-CONNECT
complaint management system

Project Overview: CIT-U Connect

Project Description:
CIT-U Connect is an online platform designed to improve the way students, staff, and faculty members report and resolve school-related issues. Currently, complaints about the school are posted publicly on social media platforms, which can negatively impact the institution's reputation and may not lead to quick resolutions. This system will offer a more professional, structured, and private way to handle complaints, ensuring that issues are addressed within the school while maintaining transparency and accountability.

The system allows users to submit complaints in various categories, interact with posted complaints through comments, and track the status of their issues. Admins will review, approve, and provide feedback on each complaint. Additionally, the platform will notify admins about trending complaints based on engagement metrics like comment count, allowing the school to identify and resolve frequently occurring issues more efficiently.

Key Features:
1. Anonymous Complaint Submission
- Allow users to submit complaints anonymously to encourage honesty without fear of retaliation.

2. Priority Levels
- Let users assign a priority level (e.g., low, medium, high) to complaints, helping admins manage urgent issues more efficiently.

3. Category Tagging
- Users can submit complaints in predefined categories (e.g., Facilities, IT, Academic Issues, etc.).
- Complaints are reviewed by an admin before they are made public.

4. Complaint Resolution Tracking
- Implement a feature that shows users the progress of their complaint (e.g., "Submitted", "Under Review", "Resolved").

5. Search and Filter
- Allow users to search and filter complaints based on category, date, status, or keyword.

6. Admin Analytics & User Interface Dashboard
- The system identifies trending complaints using a Weighted Trending Algorithm that takes into account the number of comments, unique commenters, and time decay.
- Trending complaints are highlighted for admin review, ensuring that pressing issues are prioritized.

7. Complaint Archive
- Enable users and admins to view recent & historical complaints after they are posted/resolved.

8. Admin Review and Approval (CRUD Operations)
- Admins can review complaints, assess their validity, and approve or reject them.
- They can also provide feedback or updates to the users who submitted the complaint.

9. User Interaction
- Users can comment on posted complaints, fostering discussion and providing additional insights into the issue.
- A spam detection mechanism is implemented to prevent spam comments from affecting trending complaints.

10. Notification System
- Users receive notifications (via email or in-app) when their complaint status is updated (e.g., approved, rejected, or resolved).
- Admins receive alerts about trending complaints or frequently reported issues.

Complaint Categories:
- Facilities and Infrastructure
- Academic Issues
- Administrative Services
- Campus Security and Safety
- IT and Technical Support
- Food and Cafeteria Services
- Extracurricular Activities
- Transport and Parking
- Financial Issues
- Student Discipline and Conduct

Additional Features:
- Weighted Trending Algorithm: A sophisticated algorithm that weighs comment counts, unique commenters, and the age of the complaint to determine trending issues.
- Spam Detection: Automated tools and user reporting to prevent spam comments from influencing trending complaints.
- Time-Based Comment Limits: Restrictions on how often users can post comments to avoid spam flooding.

Exclusions:
- Login/Logout: The login and logout functionality is excluded, as it is considered a default feature and does not need to be developed as part of the core project.

Target Users:
- Students
- School Staff
- Faculty Members
- School Administrators and Executives

Goals/Objectives of the CIT-U Connect:
- Provide a private and efficient platform for handling complaints.
